Dynamics
========

**NOTE:** This is a work in progress.  It is non-functional as of Aug 2015.

A Pure C99 library for solving dynamics problems.  Its only
dependency is libc.  To build and test, you also
need cmake, make (or anything else cmake can target),
and a gcc-like toolchain.

Build
-----

In the root directory, just do::

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
